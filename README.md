# NPC Combat Timer
It works similar as counters do in boss fights except this allows you to track just about anything in RuneScape. This plugin is great if you want to track averages in slayer tasks, try out new gear and compare kill times, or just add that little bit of engagement in slayer tasks to keep it more engaging!

# Settings
All of the information for display can be toggled on or off, so you can have as much or as little information on screen.

# Panel
The side panel allows you reset the data of any NPC you currently have tracked. It will give you a confirmation if you want to erase all tracking data from said NPC before deletion.

# Notes/Tips

 - As it is still in development it is prone to bugs. Please open up issues with as much detail as possible if you encounter any tracking issues, counting issues, or any feature requests.
 - The plugin works best in single-combat while I am working on getting it to work efficiently in multi-combat such as bursting/chinning.
 - If you add a new NPC to the list, toggle the plugin on and off to ensure the list gets updated and tracks correctly.
